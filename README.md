Readable is a social network for book lovers. This webapp allows users to search for their favourite book, add it to different categories, track their progress and update their followers. 
The backend is viewable [here](https://github.com/steve-alex/readable-Backend).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
